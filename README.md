# ProjectMark coding Challenge

Project executed to show my skills as a Frontend engineer at ProjectMark process.

This project was made in one night and addresses all of the points requested in the chalenge:

- ‚úÖ Must be the same as the design on the screen
- ‚úÖ We will be looking for cleanliness of code and good design patterns
- ‚úÖ The checkboxes should be actionable. When you click one of them, the columns should change. You can change whatever way you want whether it is to show less or more.
- ‚úÖ Only one checkbox can be selected at a time.
- ‚úÖ Selected checkbox should have the blue outline
- ‚úÖ Top step buttons dont have to be actionable.
- ‚úÖ Add it to github or bitbucket and provide a link to the repo
- ‚úÖ Provide setup instructions on how to set it up and view

Even tho I had little time to do it (1 night because somehow Programathor didn't send me notifications ü§î).
I've included some extras like:

- 404 page
- gh-actions configuration to deploy on gh-pages
- dark mode with a toggle
- linter configurations
- favicon and icons
