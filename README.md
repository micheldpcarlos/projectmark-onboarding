# ProjectMark coding Challenge

Project executed to show my skills as frontend engineer.

This project was made in one night and adresses all of the points requested in the :

- âœ… Must be the same as the design on the screen
- âœ… We will be looking for cleanliness of code and good design patterns
- âœ… The checkboxes should be actionable. When you click one of them, the columns should change. You can change whatever way you want whether it is to show less or more.
- âœ… Only one checkbox can be selected at a time.
- âœ… Selected checkbox should have the blue outline
- âœ… Top step buttons dont have to be actionable.
- âœ… Add it to github or bitbucket and provide a link to the repo
- âœ… Provide setup instructions on how to set it up and view


Even tho I had little time to do it (1 night because somehow Programathor didn't send me notifications ðŸ¤”).
I've included some extras like gh-pages configuration, dark mode toggle and linter configurations.
