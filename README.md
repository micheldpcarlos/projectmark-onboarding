# ProjectMark coding Challenge

Project executed to show my skills as a Frontend engineer at ProjectMark process.

This project was made in one night and adresses all of the points requested in the :

- ✅ Must be the same as the design on the screen
- ✅ We will be looking for cleanliness of code and good design patterns
- ✅ The checkboxes should be actionable. When you click one of them, the columns should change. You can change whatever way you want whether it is to show less or more.
- ✅ Only one checkbox can be selected at a time.
- ✅ Selected checkbox should have the blue outline
- ✅ Top step buttons dont have to be actionable.
- ✅ Add it to github or bitbucket and provide a link to the repo
- ✅ Provide setup instructions on how to set it up and view

Even tho I had little time to do it (1 night because somehow Programathor didn't send me notifications 🤔).
I've included some extras like:

- 404 page
- gh-actions configuration to deploy on gh-pages
- dark mode with a toggle
- linter configurations
- favicon and icons
